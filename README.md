# Welcome to San's ~~Github~~ Code Library
I'm a tech aficionado blending code and creativity. I build with python, JavaScript and I explore domains such as automation and ways through which tech and creativity meet.
I'm also a part-time visual story-teller, creating visuals, designs and graphics focused on vectors.

**I’m currently working on**; Developing several *Python* projects in the next three months to strengthen my skills and gain hands-on experience with various Python libraries.
